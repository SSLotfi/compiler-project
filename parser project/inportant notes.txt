instructions:
1- write input file path in the input file path test field
   Ex: F:\input2.txt

2- write output file path in the output file path field
   Ex: F:\output2.txt

3- test the file

4- in case the tree had overlapping nodes or was unclear :

   1- rerun the program 
   2- change the x_deviation and y_deviation parameters :
      - increasing x_deviation means the shapes will spread in the x_axis by the magnitude you         specify and same for y_deviation but in y_axis
      - use numbers in ranges of 10 - 500 as small numbers wont do much effect 
   3- again insert the same file input and output paths


program problems :

it might not work well with parantheses if they were at the begining ex: k=(p + 0)*9; or if they had "-" before them ex: t = p - (g * o);
  
Notes : 

for the given examples :

1- input2.txt works best with x_deviation = 150 and y_deviation = 50
2- input3.txt works best with x_deviation = y_deviation = 0
3- input4.txt works best with x_deviation = 250 anf y_deviation = 90 (best i could do)
